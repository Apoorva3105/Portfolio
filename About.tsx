                        A passionate and self-driven Information Technology student with a strong foundation in programming, database management, and problem-solving. I bring together technical expertise and people skills developed through diverse experiencesâ€”including hackathons, academic projects, and professional roles.

                    <p>
                        My journey began with a selection as a Deck Cadet at Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), where I honed my communication and interpersonal strengths. Later, as a Sales Representative and Interviewer at Budding Mariners, I further refined my ability to connect with people, conduct assessments, and guide aspiring professionals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       I have actively contributed to technical projects such as developing an Arduino-based automation model to visualize Malus Law and a full-stack budget management app (Xpensify). I continuously pursue technical certifications in C++, SQL, and DBMS, while actively seeking opportunities that challenge both my logical and creative thinking.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        Adaptable, collaborative, and driven by curiosity, I am eager to contribute to real-world technology solutions and grow as a problem solver in the tech industry.
